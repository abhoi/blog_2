title: Introduction to Conditional Random Fields
---

<p align="justify">Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are a class of statistical modeling method often to used to model structured data. CRFs are widely used in machine learning problems. Some specific applications include:</p>

- **Computer Vision**: Object recognition, image segmentation
- **Natural Language Processing**: POS tagging, Shallow parsing, Named entity recognition
- **Biological Sequences**: Gene finding, Peptide critical functional region finding

CRFs are used as an alternative to hidden Markov models (HMMs) as well. Conditional Random Fields were introduced in 2001 by Lafferty, John, Andrew McCallum, and Fernando CN Pereira [2].

A **conditional random field** or **CRF** is a **Markov Random Field** where all the clique potentials are conditioned on input features:

$$\scriptsize p(\textbf{y}|\textbf{x, w}) = \frac{1}{Z(\textbf{x, w})}\prod_{c} \psi_{c}(\textbf{y}_{c}|\textbf{x, w})$$

A CRF is basically a **structured ouput** extension of **logistic regression**. We can assume a log-linear representation of the potentials:

$$\scriptsize \psi_{c}(\textbf{y}_{c}|\textbf{x, w}) = exp(\textbf{w}_{c}^{T} \phi(\textbf{x, }\textbf{y}_{c}))$$

<p align='justify'>CRFs are more efficient than generative classifiers because they don't waste resources modeling things that they always observe. They only focus on the distribution of labels given data. This leads to the potentials of the model be data-dependent. If two nodes <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are discontinuous, then we can "turn off" or set the transition potential to zero. [1]</p>

We can also represent CRFs as:

$$\scriptsize p(\textbf{y}|X) = \frac{1}{Z_X}\textrm{exp}\left (\sum_{s=1}^{m} \left \langle \textbf{w}_{y_{s}}, \textbf{x}_{s} \right \rangle + \sum_{s=1}^{m-1}T_{y_{s},y_{s+1}}\right)$$

$$\scriptsize Z_X = \sum_{\mathbf{\hat{y}} \in \mathcal{Y}^{m}}^{ } \textrm{exp}\left (\sum_{s=1}^{m} \left \langle \textbf{w}_{\hat{y}_{s}}, \textbf{x}_{s} \right \rangle + \sum_{s=1}^{m-1}T_{\hat{y}_{s},\hat{y}_{s+1}}\right )$$

More to come...
